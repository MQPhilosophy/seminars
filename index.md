### Vicious BERT. An LLM to identify epistemic vices on polarized social media 

There is growing evidence that indicates that individuals with conservative ideology are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, endorse and spread misinformation and have lower trust on science. The asymmetry thesis proposes that conservatives present distinct cognitive features that makes them more susceptible to politically motivated reasoning and hence to anti science attitudes. In this work I analyse this problem through a virtue/vice epistemology framework. I contain that from the perspective of epistemic vices and virtues there is also an ideological asymmetry on how conservatives build their epistemic networks and gather, process and transmit information as a result. Conservative networks are structurally and individually vicious. Structurally they are organized around malicious agents that preclude the exercise of epistemic virtues while fostering ill epistemic practices. Individually, conservative agents tend to be more epistemically vicious which in turn enables a feedback loop with the structural properties of their networks. To explore these points, I focus on social media behaviour, particularly X (Twitter), with posts related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. I fine-tuned an LLM from the BERT family to classify tweets according to their degree of epistemic viciousness. I propose then to apply this model to a corpus of tweets from different political communities on Twitter USA. I present evidence obtained from the result of network analysis on these communities to account for the structural claim of conservative vs liberal communities. I propose to use the BERT model to compare the presence of epistemic vices at individual level on conservative networks.

### If it Pleases the Gods: The Socratic Piety of Epictetus

Epictetus’ Stoicism is distinguished by the centrality of Socrates, who serves as both role model and authorizer of the core teachings in the Discourses. A second distinctive feature is Epictetus’ unique conception of piety and the central importance he assigns to this virtue. The primary aim of this paper is to elucidate Epictetian piety and its Socratic origins. Epictetian piety comprises three attitudes inspired by the life and teachings of Socrates: optimism, gratitude, and obedience. After outlining the nature and interrelations of these attitudes, I explain how Epictetian piety can be manifested independent of religious belief. I argue that this form of piety is a neglected virtue that can promote human flourishing and ethical living in a modern secular context.

### Knowledge-when: Patient perspectives of epistemic authority

The epistemology of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) has traditionally privileged two forms of knowing: the propositional ‘knowledge-that’ derived from systematic reviews and trial data, and the clinician’s practical ‘knowledge-how’. While patient values have been appended to this model, they are typically framed as ethical preferences, serving to guide our practical responses. Our qualitative research into experimental stem-cell therapies, however, suggests that some members of the public harbour an alternative view. A sizeable minority of our sample appeal to a third, unrecognised form of purported knowledge. We term this ‘knowledge-when’: a capacity to determine when it the evidence is sufficient to move from clinical trials to common practice. In our interviews, participants grounded this claim not in an understanding of statistical evidence, nor in terms of being willing to accept risk, but in the lived experience of their condition—a form of knowing we call ‘nosomathia’. This represents a claim not just to know when it is worth taking a particular risk, but also when there is evidence of risk. Our presentation will attempt to take this claim seriously, noting that doing so would require reconfiguring EBM’s epistemic architecture to accommodate ‘knowledge-when’ alongside ‘knowledge-that’ and ‘knowledge-how’. This would position the patient as an arbiter of epistemic standards, alongside their expanded role as a part of designing the practicalities of research programmes. As we will show, even if one is not inclined to accept the particular epistemology that serves to undergird their responses, such a view does raise interesting questions as to how evidentiary standards ought to be understood in this domain.

### Journal prestige can and should be earned

With prominent threats to trust in science around the world, it is especially important to make clear why scientific institutions, including journals, are worthy of trust. Too often, journals’ reputations are unearned—based on flawed metrics such as impact factors, or simply the inertia of prestige. But journal prestige can and should be earned. Journals that invest in and facilitate both pre- and post-publication quality checks, error detection, and correction are the ones that deserve the most trust, and the most prestige.

### From (red) pandas* to vibe coding: building software for/by/with philosophers

Software packages to build networks, analyse corpora, and make informative graphics are no longer in the exclusive domain of data scientists. From experimental philosophy, to social epistemology, to philosophy of fame-and-celebrity, philosophers and cross-disciplinary researchers increasingly find utility in these packages. Making software open source is common practice, allowing people to build on existing studies, for the public good. In this talk, I will discuss my experiences building, maintaining, testing, and deploying these packages with colleagues at the Digital Trust Lab. This ranges from the exciting (launching a Python package any philosopher can install in less than 20 seconds), to the mind-numbing (having to create a myriad of test cases and documentation for adding one single piece of functionality!), to the pedantic (not updating a code base without following a series of audits). More importantly, I will discuss challenges and considerations on different approaches to take, tradeoffs between complexity/explainability and accuracy, and the kettle of fish that is Generative AI and "vibe coding". * pandas is a common Python library, which, sadly, leaves me red in the face every time I use the wrong syntax.

### Is the Buddha’s Lucky Throw Unlucky?

In Finnigan (2024), I used decision-theoretic tools to argue that the Buddha, in the Apaṇṇaka Sutta, presents a decision-problem under uncertainty about whether to ‘wager’ for karma and rebirth. This, I argued, paralleled Pascal’s Wager for belief in God in several important respects. I also showed that the Buddha resolves this decision-problem using dominance (superdominance, even superduperdominance) reasoning but then raised three objections to the idea that we are rationally required to accept this wager. I nevertheless concluded with a motivational concession: the Buddha's Wager might at least provide one more reason for someone to act well if they need. This is because the two kinds of outcomes the wager envisions – social and karmic – depend on the individual using the view at issue to inform their conduct. This talk explores a challenge to this concession; namely, that it undermines the rationality of the wager by providing a bad reason for acting. Call this the self-undermining objection. The Buddha describes his wager as a “lucky throw” that, when “accepted and undertaken… will lead to welfare and happiness for a long time.” Does accepting this wager actually constitute an “unlucky throw”, one that ultimately undermines the very welfare and happiness the Buddha asserts the wager would bring? I will argue that it is not – at least, not for the reason that it is self-undermining. I will nevertheless conclude that we are still not rationally required to accept the Buddha’s Wager – both for the reasons I provided in 2024 as well as some others.

### Quantifying the human

Quantitative measurement in the human sciences remains both widespread and controversial. Are depression scales, intelligence tests, etc. valid measurement instruments? Do they deliver quantitative or merely ordinal information? I discuss two approaches for understanding practices of quantitative measurement of theoretical attributes. One uses causal notions to characterize dispositional attributes and to understand how they relate to measurement indications. It aims at standard epistemic desiderata in science (discovery, explanation, prediction) and offers good answers to traditional worries about human attributes (namely, are they really quantitative?) and about their measurement instruments (namely, are they valid?). A second approach uses the notion of value(as in Dan Hausman's 2015 Valuing Health) to make sense of quantification practices. This approach does not resemble what scientists think of their measurement practices: it is not designed for the testing of tentative concepts but rather to standardize political decision making. Yet, I argue, this approach is the most plausible candidate for making sense of some human sciences’ measurement practices as quantifying anything. Such is the case for measurements that (i) combine distinct dimensions of the phenomena at stake and (ii) for which we don’t observe serious efforts aiming at embedding such measurements in predictive and explanatory networks. I illustrate with two examples: depression severity (HAMD) and the Human Development Index (HDI).

### Rethinking Psychological Measurement Validity

Valid measurement is critical for empirical research. Yet, a growing body of literature suggests that validation practices in the psychological sciences are highly inadequate. A lack of clarity about the concept of validity itself has been proposed as a contributing factor to poor validation practices. In this talk, I introduce a concept of measurement validity with three key features that I argue can facilitate improved validation practices in the psychological sciences. The first feature of the proposed concept of validity is that it is restricted to the question of what a test measures. This contrasts with influential guidelines from the American Psychological Association, which state that validity should be ascribed to interpretations of test scores for different test uses. The second feature is that it is based on a necessary, and in principle, sufficient causal condition for valid measurement; and the third feature is that it makes an explicit distinction between the validity potential of measurement procedures in abstracta (e.g., tests) and the realised validity of concrete measurement outcomes (e.g., specific sets of test scores). Considering each feature in turn, I describe the potential benefits and challenges of adopting this concept of validity in the context of psychological measurement.
