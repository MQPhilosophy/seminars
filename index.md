### Vicious BERT. An LLM to identify epistemic vices on polarized social media 

There is growing evidence that indicates that individuals with conservative ideology are more likely to believe in conspiracy theories, endorse and spread misinformation and have lower trust on science. The asymmetry thesis proposes that conservatives present distinct cognitive features that makes them more susceptible to politically motivated reasoning and hence to anti science attitudes. In this work I analyse this problem through a virtue/vice epistemology framework. I contain that from the perspective of epistemic vices and virtues there is also an ideological asymmetry on how conservatives build their epistemic networks and gather, process and transmit information as a result. Conservative networks are structurally and individually vicious. Structurally they are organized around malicious agents that preclude the exercise of epistemic virtues while fostering ill epistemic practices. Individually, conservative agents tend to be more epistemically vicious which in turn enables a feedback loop with the structural properties of their networks. To explore these points, I focus on social media behaviour, particularly X (Twitter), with posts related to the recent COVID-19 pandemic. I fine-tuned an LLM from the BERT family to classify tweets according to their degree of epistemic viciousness. I propose then to apply this model to a corpus of tweets from different political communities on Twitter USA. I present evidence obtained from the result of network analysis on these communities to account for the structural claim of conservative vs liberal communities. I propose to use the BERT model to compare the presence of epistemic vices at individual level on conservative networks.

### If it Pleases the Gods: The Socratic Piety of Epictetus

Epictetus’ Stoicism is distinguished by the centrality of Socrates, who serves as both role model and authorizer of the core teachings in the Discourses. A second distinctive feature is Epictetus’ unique conception of piety and the central importance he assigns to this virtue. The primary aim of this paper is to elucidate Epictetian piety and its Socratic origins. Epictetian piety comprises three attitudes inspired by the life and teachings of Socrates: optimism, gratitude, and obedience. After outlining the nature and interrelations of these attitudes, I explain how Epictetian piety can be manifested independent of religious belief. I argue that this form of piety is a neglected virtue that can promote human flourishing and ethical living in a modern secular context.

### Journal prestige can and should be earned

With prominent threats to trust in science around the world, it is especially important to make clear why scientific institutions, including journals, are worthy of trust. Too often, journals’ reputations are unearned—based on flawed metrics such as impact factors, or simply the inertia of prestige. But journal prestige can and should be earned. Journals that invest in and facilitate both pre- and post-publication quality checks, error detection, and correction are the ones that deserve the most trust, and the most prestige.
