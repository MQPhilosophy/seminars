### Ethics can't do without metaphysics

Metaphysics-phobia is rife in ethics and political philosophy. Rawls for example claims that his conception of justice is “political not metaphysical”. That orientation of the field has favoured conceptions of ethics as fundamentally about evolved customs, or “traffic rules for self-assertors” (Annette Baier), rather than views that take ethics to be seriously answerable to something in the way things are. The talk argues that foundational studies in (human) ethics should take metaphysics seriously, especially the extensive theories of supervenience (or grounding). A fundamental concept in ethics is the worth of persons – surely the main reason why murder is wrong is the terminal harm to the victim, and harm is a concept that implies the worth of the entity harmed. Worth is argued to be a metaphysically and ethically strong concept, grounded (in the metaphysicians’ sense) in properties of the human person that are not themselves ethical (classically, rationality, but modern sensibilities favour a wider base including, for example, the will, love, individuality …).

### An Absence of Judgment: AI’s Limitations in Deep Research tasks

This paper introduces the concept of "technoscholasticism" to analyse fundamental limitations in AI research tools. Through autoethnographic investigation of frontier models deployed in February 2025, we demonstrate that these systems, despite claims of "agentic" capabilities, lack three crucial dimensions of judgment: epistemic humility, inductive capacity, and correspondence with reality. Like medieval scholastics, these tools privilege textual authority over critical assessment of knowledge claims, explaining their inability to generate novel insights despite vast information access. While acknowledging potential "mundane utility" for specific research tasks, we propose architectural and methodological requirements for more effective research tools that acknowledge these inherent constraints and integrate human judgment at critical junctures. These findings contribute to both theoretical understanding of AI epistemology and practical approaches to scholarly tool design.

### Maintaining an ethical asymmetry between conserving and creating biodiversity

Environmental conservation as a practice and philosophy has been implicitly and explicitly backward-looking. It is the act of preserving, conserving, restoring, and maintaining the features of the biotic world we inherit. Increasingly, this bias has been confronted by anthropogenic environmental change and increasing capacity to address existential environmental risk with technology. There has been a call to re-evaluate and support the practice of creating new ecological arrangements (novel ecosystems) and to incorporate the value of engineered biotic novelty (novel biodiversity). This paper confronts the question of what, in principle, could justify a bias in value towards preserving biodiversity over creating biodiversity. I present two related, but ultimately independent, arguments for this position. First, I will consider methodological reasons towards preserving environmental value from axiology. There are a range of reasons that value conserved has been considered preferable to value created, beyond an unguided dispositional status quo bias (Cohen 2011; Brennan & Hamlin 2016). I argue the processes and products of deep history instantiate features that warrant asymmetrical valuation. Second, I present a reconsidered version of ‘authenticity’ as a justification for preserving biodiversity (Katz 2022). Under my presentation, authenticity refers to the evolved entanglement and interdependency of lineages and gene lineages. These interdependencies should be valued epistemologically and aesthetically.

### Quantifying the human

Quantitative measurement in the human sciences remains both widespread and controversial. Are depression scales, intelligence tests, etc. valid measurement instruments? Do they deliver quantitative or merely ordinal information? I discuss two approaches for understanding practices of quantitative measurement of theoretical attributes. One uses causal notions to characterize dispositional attributes and to understand how they relate to measurement indications. It aims at standard epistemic desiderata in science (discovery, explanation, prediction) and offers good answers to traditional worries about human attributes (namely, are they really quantitative?) and about their measurement instruments (namely, are they valid?). A second approach uses the notion of value(as in Dan Hausman's 2015 Valuing Health) to make sense of quantification practices. This approach does not resemble what scientists think of their measurement practices: it is not designed for the testing of tentative concepts but rather to standardize political decision making. Yet, I argue, this approach is the most plausible candidate for making sense of some human sciences’ measurement practices as quantifying anything. Such is the case for measurements that (i) combine distinct dimensions of the phenomena at stake and (ii) for which we don’t observe serious efforts aiming at embedding such measurements in predictive and explanatory networks. I illustrate with two examples: depression severity (HAMD) and the Human Development Index (HDI).

### Knowledge-When: Patient Perspectives of Epistemic Authority

The epistemology of Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) has traditionally privileged two forms of knowing: the propositional ‘knowledge-that’ derived from systematic reviews and trial data, and the clinician’s practical ‘knowledge-how’. While patient values have been appended to this model, they are typically framed as ethical preferences, serving to guide our practical responses. Our qualitative research into experimental stem-cell therapies, however, suggests that some members of the public harbour an alternative view.

A sizeable minority of our sample appeal to a third, unrecognised form of purported knowledge. We term this ‘knowledge-when’: a capacity to determine when it the evidence is sufficient to move from clinical trials to common practice. In our interviews, participants grounded this claim not in an understanding of statistical evidence, nor in terms of being willing to accept risk, but in the lived experience of their condition—a form of knowing we call ‘nosomathia’. This represents a claim not just to know when it is worth taking a particular risk, but also when there is evidence of risk.

Our presentation will attempt to take this claim seriously, noting that doing so would require reconfiguring EBM’s epistemic architecture to accommodate ‘knowledge-when’ alongside ‘knowledge-that’ and ‘knowledge-how’. This would position the patient as an arbiter of epistemic standards, alongside their expanded role as a part of designing the practicalities of research programmes. As we will show, even if one is not inclined to accept the particular epistemology that serves to undergird their responses, such a view does raise interesting questions as to how evidentiary standards ought to be understood in this domain.

### Rethinking Psychological Measurement Validity

Valid measurement is critical for empirical research. Yet, a growing body of literature suggests that validation practices in the psychological sciences are highly inadequate. A lack of clarity about the concept of validity itself has been proposed as a contributing factor to poor validation practices. In this talk, I introduce a concept of measurement validity with three key features that I argue can facilitate improved validation practices in the psychological sciences. The first feature of the proposed concept of validity is that it is restricted to the question of what a test measures. This contrasts with influential guidelines from the American Psychological Association, which state that validity should be ascribed to interpretations of test scores for different test uses. The second feature is that it is based on a necessary, and in principle, sufficient causal condition for valid measurement; and the third feature is that it makes an explicit distinction between the validity potential of measurement procedures in abstracta (e.g., tests) and the realised validity of concrete measurement outcomes (e.g., specific sets of test scores). Considering each feature in turn, I describe the potential benefits and challenges of adopting this concept of validity in the context of psychological measurement.
