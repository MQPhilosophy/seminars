### Ethics can't do without metaphysics

Metaphysics-phobia is rife in ethics and political philosophy. Rawls for example claims that his conception of justice is “political not metaphysical”. That orientation of the field has favoured conceptions of ethics as fundamentally about evolved customs, or “traffic rules for self-assertors” (Annette Baier), rather than views that take ethics to be seriously answerable to something in the way things are. The talk argues that foundational studies in (human) ethics should take metaphysics seriously, especially the extensive theories of supervenience (or grounding). A fundamental concept in ethics is the worth of persons – surely the main reason why murder is wrong is the terminal harm to the victim, and harm is a concept that implies the worth of the entity harmed. Worth is argued to be a metaphysically and ethically strong concept, grounded (in the metaphysicians’ sense) in properties of the human person that are not themselves ethical (classically, rationality, but modern sensibilities favour a wider base including, for example, the will, love, individuality …).

### An Absence of Judgment: AI’s Limitations in Deep Research tasks

This paper introduces the concept of "technoscholasticism" to analyse fundamental limitations in AI research tools. Through autoethnographic investigation of frontier models deployed in February 2025, we demonstrate that these systems, despite claims of "agentic" capabilities, lack three crucial dimensions of judgment: epistemic humility, inductive capacity, and correspondence with reality. Like medieval scholastics, these tools privilege textual authority over critical assessment of knowledge claims, explaining their inability to generate novel insights despite vast information access. While acknowledging potential "mundane utility" for specific research tasks, we propose architectural and methodological requirements for more effective research tools that acknowledge these inherent constraints and integrate human judgment at critical junctures. These findings contribute to both theoretical understanding of AI epistemology and practical approaches to scholarly tool design.

### Pursuing the Good, Moved by the Good: How Desires Motivate

Desires have a puzzling dual character. In one sense, desires are passive. Desires are spontaneous, and not the result of reasoning or voluntary choice. The experience of desiring is spontaneous: I find myself moved to acquire the object of desire. Desires look like a constraint on agency. Yet, in another sense, desires are active. My desire is not something separate from me and I don’t simply observe it as an inner event. Rather, the desire consists of my moving myself in pursuit of the object of my desire. Desires look like an exercise of agency. So, my desire is both a constraint on my agency and an exercise of my agency: what simply happens to me is something I do. How is the dual character of desire possible? I explore several possible answers that attempt to “split” the self into two, or the event of desiring into two mental states, or the intentionality of desires into two distinct relations. I use this discussion to motivate my own preferred view that explains the duality of desire in terms of a more fundamental unifying factor. On this view, the active and passive dimensions of desires result from a discrimination of value.

### Rethinking Psychological Measurement Validity

Valid measurement is critical for empirical research. Yet, a growing body of literature suggests that validation practices in the psychological sciences are highly inadequate. A lack of clarity about the concept of validity itself has been proposed as a contributing factor to poor validation practices. In this talk, I introduce a concept of measurement validity with three key features that I argue can facilitate improved validation practices in the psychological sciences. The first feature of the proposed concept of validity is that it is restricted to the question of what a test measures. This contrasts with influential guidelines from the American Psychological Association, which state that validity should be ascribed to interpretations of test scores for different test uses. The second feature is that it is based on a necessary, and in principle, sufficient causal condition for valid measurement; and the third feature is that it makes an explicit distinction between the validity potential of measurement procedures in abstracta (e.g., tests) and the realised validity of concrete measurement outcomes (e.g., specific sets of test scores). Considering each feature in turn, I describe the potential benefits and challenges of adopting this concept of validity in the context of psychological measurement.
